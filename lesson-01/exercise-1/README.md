Create a list of numbers from 1 to 20

```haskell
Prelude> a = [1..20]
```

and get the even numbers from that list, multiplied by 2:

```haskell
Prelude> ???
[4,8,12,16,20,24,28,32,36,40]
```

> **TIP:** Use [list comprehension](https://wiki.haskell.org/List_comprehension) (or, alternatively, the `filter` and `map` functions).
>
> **TIP:** Use the `even` function, which takes an Int and returns a Bool.
